# ScholarNetwork
This is a shiny app designed to visualize the network of scholars based on data from Google Scholar. 
The app is based on Pablo Barber√°'s great work that you can find at <https://github.com/pablobarbera/scholarnetwork>

# Example output
If you enter Professor Alan Ker's Goolge Scholar page <https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=z-FBV_MAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao>, 
the output would be 
![Scholar Network of A Ker.](/Users/zshang/Documents/research/project x/ScholarNetworknewUI/aker.png).

You can check any scholar's newtwork as long as she is on Google Scholar. If you have any comments or suggestions, feel free to email me at zshang@uoguelph.ca
